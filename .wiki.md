# Project Summary
The project is a pet-focused platform that fosters a community for pet lovers, providing user authentication, social interactions with anonymity, and a marketplace for pet-related products and services. Users can connect, share experiences, and access high-quality pet products. Recent updates have improved the user experience with enhanced seller accounts, allowing users to manage their own shops and products, as well as improved features for user logout and profile management. Additionally, the platform now supports a guest mode for browsing.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of two main modules:
- **Backend**: Manages user authentication, data management, and business logic, including product and shop management.
- **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for interaction with the platform, including social features and shopping experiences.
